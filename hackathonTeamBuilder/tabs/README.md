# Build UI-based Apps for Teams

Microsoft Teams supports the ability to run web-based UI inside "custom tabs" that users can install either for just themselves (personal tabs) or within a team or group chat context.

## Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- An M365 account. If you do not have M365 account, apply one from [M365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program)
- [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) or [TeamsFx CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-cli)

## Create an application

- From Visual Studio Code, open command palette and select `Teams: Create New Project`. Or from the CLI, (after `npm install -g @microsoft/teamsfx-cli`) run command `teamsfx new`.
- Choose the "Custom tab" capability from the prompts.

## Debug

Start debugging the project by hitting the `F5` key in Visual Studio Code. Alternatively use the `Run and Debug Activity Panel` in Visual Studio Code and click the `Start Debugging` green arrow button.

## Edit the manifest

You can find the Teams manifest in `.fx/manifest.source.json`. It contains template arguments with `{...}` statements which will be replaced at build time. You may add any extra properties or permissions you require to this file. See the [schema reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema) for more.

## Deploy to Azure

Deploy your project to Azure by following these steps:

| From Visual Studio Code                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Using TeamsFx CLI                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| <ul><li>Open Teams Toolkit, and sign into Azure by clicking the `Sign in to Azure` under the `ACCOUNTS` section from sidebar.</li> <li>After you signed in, select a subscription under your account.</li><li>Open the command palette and select: `Teams: Provision in the Cloud`.</li><li>Open the command palette and select: `Teams: Deploy to the Cloud`.</li></ul> | <ul> <li>Run command `teamsfx account login azure`.</li> <li>Run command `teamsfx account set --subscription <your-subscription-id>`.</li> <li> Run command `teamsfx provision`.</li> <li>Run command: `teamsfx deploy`. </li></ul> |

> Note: Provisioning and deployment may incur charges to your Azure Subscription.

## Preview

Once the provisioning and deployment steps are finished, you can preview your app:

1. From Visual Studio Code, open the `Run and Debug Activity Panel`.
1. Select `Launch Remote (Edge)` or `Launch Remote (Chrome)` from the launch configuration drop-down.
1. Press the Play (green arrow) button to launch your app - now running remotely from Azure.

## Validate manifest file

To check that your manifest file is valid:

- From Visual Studio Code: open the command palette and select: `Teams: Validate App Manifest File`.
- From TeamsFx CLI: run command `teamsfx validate` in your project directory.

## Build

- From Visual Studio Code: open the command palette and select `Teams: Build Teams Package`.
- Alternatively, from the command line run `teamsfx build` in the project directory.

## Publish to Teams

Once deployed, you may want to distribute your application to your organization's internal app store in Teams. Your app will be submitted for admin approval.

- From Visual Studio Code: open the command palette and select: `Teams: Publish to Teams`.
- From TeamsFx CLI: run command `teamsfx publish` in your project directory.
